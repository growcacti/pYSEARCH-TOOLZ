Overview
The provided Python code implements a GUI-based application named PyGrepSim that performs text-based pattern matching in files. It supports advanced features like:

Recursive search through directories.
Regex-based multiple keyword matching.
Selection of file extensions to ignore.
Surrounding context lines for matched results.
Grouping and copying matched files to a new directory.
Dynamic GUI with customization options using tkinter.
Key Features
Search Patterns:
Allows the user to input multiple patterns, separated by commas.
Supports regular expressions for advanced matching.
Case Sensitivity:
Offers an option for case-insensitive searches.
Recursive Search:
Enables searching through subdirectories.
Line Context:
Allows customization of lines displayed before and after matches.
Ignored Extensions:
Lets users select file extensions to exclude during the search.
Matched Files:
Lists all files containing matches in a Listbox.
Allows grouping and copying these files to a specified directory.
Code Breakdown
Imports
Core Libraries:
os: To interact with the file system.
re: For regular expression matching.
shutil: For copying files.
time: For timestamp generation.
tkinter: For GUI development.
Class: PyGrepSim
This is the main class of the program, encapsulating all functionality. It interacts with the GUI components and handles user actions.

Initialization (__init__)
Sets up the main application window (root) and initializes important variables:

self.var_recursive: Boolean for recursive search.
self.var_case_insensitive: Boolean for case-insensitive matching.
self.path: Default path set to the user's home directory.
self.matched_files: Stores the list of files containing matches.
self.ignored_extensions: A set to store user-defined file extensions to exclude.
self.all_extensions: A predefined list of file extensions the user can choose to ignore.
Calls self.setup_gui() to create the GUI components.

GUI Components
The GUI is divided into several sections, each serving a specific purpose:

Options Frame (create_options_frame):

Input field for search patterns.
Checkboxes for recursive and case-insensitive options.
Buttons for browsing directories and opening the extension selector.
File Frame (create_file_frame):

Displays matched files in a Listbox.
Button to group and copy matched files to a directory.
Lines Control Frame (create_lines_control_frame):

Spinboxes to set the number of lines displayed before and after each match.
Buttons to start the search and clear all results.
Text Area (create_text_area):

A scrollable text widget to display search results.
Key Methods
open_extension_selector:

Opens a popup window listing all extensions from self.all_extensions.
Allows the user to select extensions to ignore using Checkbutton widgets.
Updates self.ignored_extensions when the user clicks "Save."
search_for_pattern:

Clears previous results.
Reads search patterns from the input field, splitting them by commas.
Iterates through the selected directory and its subdirectories (if recursive).
Filters out files with ignored extensions.
Calls process_file to process each eligible file.
process_file:

Reads the contents of a file and searches for matches using the provided patterns.
If a match is found:
Adds the file to self.matched_files.
Displays the matched lines and their context in the text area.
Surrounding lines are calculated using the lines_before and lines_after spinboxes.
group_and_copy_files:

Copies all matched files into a new directory named matched_files_<timestamp>.
Uses shutil.copy to perform the file copying.
clear_all:

Clears the text area, listbox, and self.matched_files.
Main Block
The script includes the following block to ensure it runs as a standalone program:

python
Copy code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = PyGrepSim(root)
    root.mainloop()
tk.Tk(): Initializes the main GUI window.
root.mainloop(): Starts the GUI event loop, allowing the application to respond to user interactions.
Workflow
Launch Application:
Run the script to open the GUI.
Configure Search:
Input patterns, choose case sensitivity and recursion options.
Set ignored extensions if needed.
Perform Search:
Browse to select a directory and click "Search."
View matched files and results in the Listbox and text area.
Save Results:
Group and copy matched files to a chosen directory.
Customizations
Dynamic Extension List: The self.all_extensions list can be dynamically generated based on files in the selected directory.
File Type Filter: Update the file extensions processed (.txt, .log, .py) in process_file.
Performance: For large directories, implement multithreading to prevent the UI from freezing.
